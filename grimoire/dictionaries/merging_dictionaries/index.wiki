! Problem:

You have two dictionaries {{{d1}}} and {{{d2}}}. You wish to add the key/value
pairs from {{{d2}}} to {{{d1}}}. 

! Solution:
 
The {{{update}}} method of a dictionary adds the contents of another
dictionary. To solve this problem, you can simply do: {{{d1.update(d2)}}}. 
 
{{{d1.update(d2)}}} is equivalent to the following code: 
 
{{{
for key, value in d2.items():
   d1[ key ] = value
}}}
 
If the same key is associated with a value in both {{{d1}}} and {{{d2}}},
{{{update()}}} will replace the value in {{{d1}}} with the value from {{{d2}}}.
{{{d2}}} is never modified by this method.
