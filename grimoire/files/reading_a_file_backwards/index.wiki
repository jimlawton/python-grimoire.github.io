! Problem:

You want to process a file, but starting with the last lines first.

! Partial Solution:

If you can read the entire file into memory, you can simply read all the data
into a list and then reverse the list:
 
{{{
L = open('myFile').readlines()
L.reverse()
}}}
 
On a character-by-character basis, a similarly memory-bound solution is: 
 
{{{
import string
L = string.split(open('thefile', 'r').read(), '')
L.reverse()
}}}
