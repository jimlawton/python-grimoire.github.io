Suppose you have the following dictionary:

{{{
d = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}
}}}

And you want to filter it so that you can only see the keys in:

{{{
f = ['a','b']
}}}

The easiest way to go about that is to build a set of tuples inside a list
comprehension and turn the result into a dictionary like so:

{{{
filtered = dict([(k,v) for k,v in d.items() if k in f])
}}}

For instance, it may be handy to grab some local variables (from
{{{locals()}}}) and put them into a {{{dict}}}:

{{{
somelocals = dict([(k,v) for k,v in locals().items() if k in
['author','date','title']])
}}}
