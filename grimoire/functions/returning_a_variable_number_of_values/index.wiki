! Problem:

You want to have a function that returns more than one value as its result. For
example, you may have a function that takes a colour name, and returns three
numbers, the red, green, and blue values for that colour. 

! Solution:

The simplest and most common solution is to return a tuple containing the
different values: 
 
{{{
def get_rgb_colour(colour_name):
   # ... set R, G, B, to the values
   return R, G, B
}}}

! Discussion:

An alternative solution, using a class instance to hold return values, is
useful if you want to return very many values, or differing numbers of values
in different cases. You would set instance values of the class instance, and
then return the instance to the caller. 

{{{
class RGBSetting: pass

def get_rgb_colour(colour_name):
   retval = RGBSetting()
   # ... set retval.R, retval.G, retval.B, to the values
   return retval
}}}
