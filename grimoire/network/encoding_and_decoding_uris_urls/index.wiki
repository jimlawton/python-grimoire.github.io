! Problem:

You have a URL with hex-encoded characters like:
{{{
http://localhost/With%20Spaces.html
}}}

...and you want to decode the hex characters. [[PHP]] coders will immediately
look for {{{urldecode()}}}, which does not exist in [[Python]].

! Solution:

Use {{{urllib.unquote()}}} or {{{urllib.unquote_plus()}}} instead.
