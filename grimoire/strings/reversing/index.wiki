! Problem:

You want to reverse a string ({{{cba}}} from {{{abc}}}), and yet you cannot find a {{{strings}}} method do do it.

! Solution:

There is a rather hackish one-liner to reverse a string, which relies on [[extended slices|http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.5/whatsnew/section-slices.html]]:

{{{
>>> text='foobar' 
>>> print text[::-1] 
raboof 
}}}
