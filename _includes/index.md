The core of the Grimoire was originally developed and released by Andrew M. Kuchling in May, 1999. However, it never reached a stage where Andrew felt that it was ready for publication, and eventually he withdrew it. Steve Ferg, however, had found the Grimoire very helpful as he was learning Python, and he persuaded Andrew to allow him to take over maintenance of the document in August, 2002.

In December 2004, Andrew and Steve released the Grimoire under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License 2.0][cc2] and [Rui Carmo][rc] began hosting it at [The Tao of Mac][tao], where it lingered until Rui decided to re-cast it in [TiddlyWiki][tw] format for ease of use.

Nine years later, it's being (slowly) re-cast as a set of Github pages, in the spirit of the age.
