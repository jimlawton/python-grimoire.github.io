Remember that Python is extremely dynamic and that you can use this dynamism to
configure a program at run-time to use available functionality on different
platforms. For example you can test the sys.platform and import different
modules based on its value. 
 
{{{
import sys
if sys.platform == "win32":
   import win32pipe
   popen = win32pipe.popen
else:
   import os
   popen = os.popen
}}}
 
Also, you can try to import a module and use a fallback if the import fails: 
 
{{{
try:
   import really_fast_implementation
   choice = really_fast_implementation
except ImportError:
   import slower_implementation
   choice = slower_implementation
}}}
 
This is commonly used to write code which will use a faster C extension module
if it's installed, but will still work without the extension.
