! Problem:

You wish to display a random line from a file.

! Solution:

If you are dealing with a short file, you can produce a list containing all the
lines, and then choose items at random:
 
{{{
lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
# or file.readlines(), where file is a file object
while lines:
  line = random.choice(lines)
  lines.remove(line)
  print line,
}}}
