A useful trick you can pull off with Python is to set up a small web server at
a moment's notice (mostly as a one-off file share for those occasions when you
simply can't get files across any other way).

To do that, create a short shell script containing:

{{{
#!/bin/sh
python -c '__import__("SimpleHTTPServer").test()'
}}}

(or just alias the {{{python}}} invocation in your shell)

{{{SimpleHTTPServer}}} defaults to port 8000 and serving files from wherever
you invoke it. It is not spectacularly smart, but should to a good enough job
of serving simple demos and the odd file.

Be sure to use "Save Link As..." when downloading Office files from it, since
it does not have all the [[MIME]] types defined.
