! Problem:

You want to split a string starting from the far (i.e. right-hand) side yet you cannot find a {{{strings}}} method do do it ({{{rsplit}}} was only introduced in 2.4).

! Solution:

Here's an approach that leverages the [[Reversing Strings]] one-liner:

{{{
def rsplit(s, sep=None, maxsplit=-1):
  """
  Equivalent to str.split, except splitting from the right.
  """
  if sys.version_info < (2, 4, 0):
    if sep is not None:
      sep = sep[::-1]
    L = s[::-1].split(sep, maxsplit)
    L.reverse()
    return [s[::-1] for s in L]
  else:
    return s.rsplit(sep, maxsplit) 
}}}
