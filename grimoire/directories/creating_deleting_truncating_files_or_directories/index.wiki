To delete (remove, unlink) a file, use {{{os.remove(filename)}}} or
{{{os.unlink(filename)}}} 
 
For documentation, see the posix section of the library manual. They are the
same: {{{unlink()}}} is simply the Unix name for this function. 
 
To remove a directory  {{{os.rmdir()}}}
 
To create a directory  {{{os.mkdir()}}}
 
To rename a file  {{{os.rename()}}}
 
To truncate a file, open it using{{{ f = open(filename, "r+")}}}, and use
{{{f.truncate(offset)}}}
 
(The offset defaults to the current seek position. The {{{ "r+"}}} mode opens
the file for reading and writing.) 
 
There's also {{{os.ftruncate(fd, offset)}}} for files opened with
{{{os.open()}}}  for advanced Unix hacks only.
