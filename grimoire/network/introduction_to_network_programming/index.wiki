The rise of the Internet has greatly eased the life of network programmers, by
reducing the importance of proprietary standards and replacing them with open
protocols whose specifications are readily available. Various standard Internet
protocols, such as the Simple Mail Transport Protocol ([[SMTP]]) for electronic
mail, or the Web's HyperText Transfer Protocol ([[HTTP]]), now dominate their
respective niches. 

Python's standard library includes many modules that implement different
Internet protocols, and some frameworks (like [[Twisted]]) take those
implementations beyond the basics, allowing you to code just about any sort of
client (or server) imaginable.

The basics, however, are well represented in the standard library, mostly in
the form of classes like <<PythonModule SocketServer>> and <<PythonModule
SimpleHTTPServer>>.
