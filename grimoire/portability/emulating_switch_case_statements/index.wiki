The [[Conversion Script]] that [[I|Rui Carmo]] used to convert the original
HTML version into TiddlyWiki format shows a possible way to emulate
{{{switch}}} statements in Python using exceptions:

{{{
...
    try:
      raise intern(str(tag))
    except ('tr', 'thead'):
      self.buffer += '\n'
    except ('th'):
      self.buffer += '|!'
    except ('blockquote'):
      self.buffer += '\n<<<\n'
    except:
      pass
}}}

This is actually not a very good example, since the use of {{{intern}}} is
likely to be deprecated soon. Nevertheless, right now it ensures that
{{{except}}} will deal with the results of string conversion properly.
