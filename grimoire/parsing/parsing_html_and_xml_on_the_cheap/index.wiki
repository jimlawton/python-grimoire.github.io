The [[Conversion Script]] is a very simple demo of how to parse clean,
structured [[HTML]] using the standard <<PythonModule HTMLParser>> object. The
<<PythonModule HTMLParser>> is actually a lot more flexible than it seems, and
can be used for simple [[XML]] parsing as well.

However, if you have to deal with mis-formatted [[HTML]] or don't want to get
into the complexity of Python [[XML]] bindings, a nice alternative might be
[[BeautifulSoup|http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/]], which despite
requiring some tinkering with (and probably more documentation and samples),
can handle pretty much anything on the Web.

But any mention of [[XML]] parsing wouldn't be complete without mentioning
[[RSS]] or [[Atom]] feeds, which are best handled with [[Mark Pilgrim]]'s
[[Universal Feed Parser|http://feedparser.org/]]. currently the basis for many
Python-based news aggregators.
