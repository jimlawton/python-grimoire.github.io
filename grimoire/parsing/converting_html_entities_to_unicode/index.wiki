! Problem:

You have a text buffer containing [[HTML]] character entities and need to
render them in [[Unicode]] text, replacing each entity with a single symbol.

! Solution:

Use [[BeautifulSoup|http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/]], which can
do all the dirty work for you in a one-liner:

{{{
from BeautifulSoup import *

symbols = unicode(BeautifulStoneSoup(buffer,
convertEntities=BeautifulStoneSoup.HTML_ENTITIES))
}}}
