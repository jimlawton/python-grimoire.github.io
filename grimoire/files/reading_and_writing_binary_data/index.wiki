Use the struct module. It allows you to take a string read from a file
containing binary data (usually numbers) and convert it to Python objects; and
vice versa. 
 
For example, the following code reads two 4-byte integers in big-endian format
from a file: 
 
{{{
  import struct
 f = open(filename, "rb")  # Open in binary mode for portability
 s = f.read(8)
 x, y = struct.unpack(">ll", s)
}}}
 
The '>' in the format string forces big-endian data; each letter 'l' reads one
"long integer" (4 bytes) from the string. 
 
You can refer to the Library Reference for more details about the struct
module.
